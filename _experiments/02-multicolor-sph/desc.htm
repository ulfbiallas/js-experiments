Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a numerical method for fluid simulations.
In opposite to grid-based techniques which simulate fluids by solving the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations numerically, SPH offers a particle-based approach.

In this experiment, I mix up two sets of particles with different masses. Particles belonging to the same set have the same color.

Use the mouse to interact with the particles!
